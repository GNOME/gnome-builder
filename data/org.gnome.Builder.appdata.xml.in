    <release version="3.27.4" date="2018-01-08">
      <description>
        <p>
          A number of performance improvements and bug fixes have landed in this release.
          Notably, the project tree now supports displaying status from the Version Control System.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A new IdeVcsMonitor interface provides status tracking for project files. This can be used to show the status in the project tree.</li>
          <li>The editor supports Drag'n'Drop to open files, also allowing placement of the editor frame to the left/right/top/bottom of an existing editor frame.</li>
          <li>A new message pane allows plugins to deliver information to users, particular about failures which would otherwise be silently dropped to the console. It is hidden until the first message is displayed.</li>
          <li>A number of improvements to subsystems for better error tracking, memory leaks, and correctness fixes.</li>
          <li>Save-All shortcut has been fixed.</li>
          <li>The “hamburger” menu has been hidden by default, but will automatically display if any plugins end up using it. Currently, all plugins have removed their use of it.</li>
          <li>Fullscreen now has a top-level button.</li>
          <li>Newcomers greeter section now displays the included programming languages to help guide developers to projects they may want to contribute to.</li>
          <li>The omnibar now includes a button to download dependencies.</li>
          <li>Unit tests are reloaded whenever the build pipeline is updated.</li>
          <li>Symbol Tree will now more reliably show document contents.</li>
          <li>Builder can now chain GCancellables together, meaning more reliable cancellation of complex operations such as project building.</li>
          <li>The build status panel can now display the build pipeline stages and update them as the build progresses.</li>
          <li>The Clang plugin will more reliably work when used to build against a host system from Builder shipped via Flatpak.</li>
          <li>Support for LLVM 5.0.</li>
          <li>Various compilation fixes for FreeBSD.</li>
        </ul>
      </description>
    </release>

    <release version="3.27.3" date="2017-12-11">
      <description>
        <p>
          A number of performance improvements and bug fixes have landed in this release.
          Notably, the project tree will now automatically update when changes are discovered and includes status from version control.
          Also, you can now Drag'n'Drop items in the project tree.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Debugging with gdb has been improved to translate paths when running inside of a mount namespace such as flatpak.</li>
          <li>Improvements to eslint and GJS code indexers to be more flexible with other JS runtimes such as NodeJS.</li>
          <li>A number of correctness fixes in plumbing and for memory leaks.</li>
          <li>A new build target provider interface has been added so the project runner can support executing commands extracted from systems such as flatpak.</li>
          <li>GNOME Night Light integration.</li>
          <li>Improved greeter sections with support removing data files.</li>
          <li>Builder will try to remove stale cache data at startup and shutdown to help free some disk usage.</li>
          <li>Project cache data has been moved into a directory by project, making it easier to remove cache data when a project is removed.</li>
          <li>Improved alignments for home/end shortcuts.</li>
          <li>The build pipeline now uses a PTY and VteTerminal to gain color support and extraction of PTY sequences. This allows for proper message titles in the omnibar when building. One regression currently is that we no longer extract Regex-based error messages.</li>
          <li>You can now run Cargo-based projects using cargo run.</li>
          <li>Access to /usr and /etc from the host system when running under Flatpak (via /run/host) allows Builder to develop against a host system. Users of Builder on CentOS/RHEL/LTS distros are the most likely to benefit from this feature.</li>
          <li>The build pipeline tries to be more verbose for known error messages in GLib by setting G_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTIC.</li>
          <li>Builder now uses --state-dir with flatpak-builder when 0.10.5 or greater of flatpak-builder is detected.</li>
          <li>The project-tree now supports Drag'n'Drop, both internally and using text/uri-list selections from external applications.</li>
          <li>An early preview of VCS status integration into the project tree has been included in this release.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Support for code-indexing the Vala programming language.</li>
