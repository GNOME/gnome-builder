Jump to Definition
##################

Builder supports jumping to the definition of a symbol.
It is a quick and easy way to navigate the source of your project.

If you're using the default or Emacs-based keybindings, use ``Alt+.`` while the insertion mark is on the symbol name.
If you're using Vim-based keybindings, use the ``gd`` while the cursor is on the symbol name.

If you're located at the declaration of a symbol (such as in a header file), you can jump to the implementation using this method.
This requires that the ``code-index`` plugin is enabled.
