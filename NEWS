===============
Version 3.25.92
===============

Changes since last release:

 • A new word completion provider that uses distance from cursor for sorting.
   This is currently exposed via ctrl+n/ctrl+p when in Vim mode. We may expand
   this to other keybindings in the future.
 • Documentation cards can now be shown using the "request-documentation"
   keybinding signal in the code editor. "Shift+K" activates this in Vim mode,
   F2 with traditional keybindings.
 • A new code indexing engine that will index your project in the background
   to improve search and code navigation features is now included. Currently,
   only the clang plugin provides a suitable indexer, but other languages will
   be supported in the future.
 • A global search provider using the fuzzy-search code-index allows jumping
   to a function, class, and other language features.
 • A symbol resolver based on the code-index allows jumping between source
   and declarations.
 • Plugins can now register long running "pausable" operations with the
   project context. The code-index supports this for background indexing.
 • A technology preview for debugger integration has landed. It allows
   debugging projects both on the host as well as applications running inside
   of flatpak mount/pid/network namespaces.
 • A reference debugger backend has been implemented using gdb. Although it is
   entirely expected that Builder will gain support for other debugger backends
   in a future release.
 • Builder now tries to reduce the number of shell notifications it generates.
 • A new history plugin is added to bring back lost history functionality during
   the UI revamp. It can be activated with ctrl+o/ctrl+i in Vim mode, or via the
   back/forward buttons in the document stack header.
 • Documentation improvements.
 • Various project templates have been improved.
 • CSS style refinements.
 • Clang completion provider improvements.

Thanks to all of our contributors and a special thanks to our three GSoC
students this summer who did an outstanding job implementing great new features
for Builder!

===============
Version 3.25.91
===============

Changes since last release:

 • Build systems can not implement an optimized path to extract build flags for
   multiple files at once. This will be useful for upcoming code indexing
   features.
 • Mkdir pipeline stages can now request that directories are reaped at cleanup.
 • The buffer manager can now protect against a single file being requested
   multiple times while a previous load is in-flight.
 • Various GAction fixes.
 • A new documentation-card plugin has been included as part of the Summer '17
   GSoC work. It provides documentation on functions from devhelp when you hover
   the mouse pointer over a function or other type. It supports multiple backends,
   but only Devhelp is currently implemented.
 • A leak of various editor view plugins due to a bug in IdeExtensionSetAdapter
   has been plugged.
 • The beautifier plugin has been ported to the new UI design.
 • The spellcheck plugin got numerous fixes from fallout during the UI redesign.
 • The XML plugin got a fix for a potential NULL deref.
 • The volume monitor has been restored on the editor.
 • Many widgets and plugins have been ported to the new shortcut engine.
 • The shortcut window should now work better on smaller screen sizes.
 • "Insert matching brance" has been moved to a per-language setting.

===============
Version 3.25.90
===============

Changes since last release:

 • Indentation fixes when using the fallback indenter.
 • Various UI changes as we progress on the UI revamp.
 • Diagnostics checks now blocked until the buffer has fully loaded.
 • Highlight engine fixes for the recently added pause support.
 • "Export" has been moved to a generic operation from the omnibar.
 • A crash in the diagnostics manager has been fixed due to incorrect
   assertions at runtime.
 • Many keyboard shortcut fixes.
 • The search bar has had missing pieces from the revamp ported.
   This includes better keyboard interactions.
 • Search navigation has been restored from the source editor.
 • Our BuilderBlocks font has been improved to support both lower
   and upper-case glyphs.
 • Builder no longer uses Gtk's setting for sort-directories-first.
 • Builder now supports a "run-opts" in .buildconfig files or
   x-run-args in flatpak json files to pass arguments when running
   the target application.
 • The spellchecker has had a number of fixes that were broken during
   the UI revamp.
 • find-other-file will jump right to the matching file if only one
   is matched. This more closely matches our previous implementation.
 • The build pipeline now recognizes filenames with _ in them when
   generating diagnostics.

==============
Version 3.25.5
==============

We are releasing 3.25.5 as a quick followup to 3.25.4. It fixes a number of
issues that were discovered and fixed shortly after merging the new layout
branch.

 • HTML Preview shortcut is fixed
 • Various keybindings have been improved in libdazzle
 • We now bundle the proper libdazzle version as a subproject
 • IdeSourceViewMode now holds a reference to the view and copies all
   GValues when marshaling to the proxied closure
 • Focus tracking has been fixed for stacks in a single column
 • The focus-neighbor action works again, allowing ^w^w and other Vim style
   keybindings to work correctly
 • Activation of F-keys while in vim "normal mode" has been fixed
 • Builder now depends on the proper version of GLib for access to
   g_ptr_array_find_with_equal_func()
 • MIT/X11 license has been updated to include a missing stanza
 • Cross-architecture printf fixes

Thanks to all our early testers who reported bugs!


==============
Version 3.25.4
==============

This release of Builder contains the largest UI change since the creation of
Builder. As this is mid-development cycle towards GNOME 3.26, we anticipate
breakage in this release. However, we value the time that people put into
testing things for us and doubly so for those that file bugs.

Generally, we try to keep the master branch fairly stable and usable. This
release will almost certainly have regressions due to the nature of the
redesign.

 • A new keybinding engine is being used. It is very young but maturing
   quickly. Great pain has been experienced to merge the desires for
   features we need with the backwards compatability to keep existing
   features working such as the Vim compatability engine.
 • A new layout engine has been added. It has a few tricks up it's sleeve.
   It can animate widgets between grid locations. It also can highlight
   the view header to match the primary contents of the view. Under the
   hood, the implementation has been vastly simplified.
 • Over/under splits can now contain separate documents and you are no
   longer limited to two.
 • The project tree has been modified to look/feel more like a listbox.
   Future releases of Builder will keep the project-tree, but it will
   likely be disabled by default in favor of a DzlStackList-based
   navigation.
 • The TODO plugin has been ported to C. It goes through a reasonable
   amount of effort to keep memory allocations contiguous and footprint low.
 • Spellcheck has been moved into a plugin.
 • Color picker and spellcheck have been ported to use the new
   "transient sidebar". They come into focus when it makes sense for them
   to be visible based on context.
 • The symbol panel has been moved into the document header. It has also
   been styled to feel more like a listbox with hover state.
 • Devhelp browsing has been moved into the document header for the
   devhelp documentation view. It's a little bare at first, and we anticipate
   this to improve in future snapshots.
 • The terminal supports the "primary-color" feature to style the document
   header inline with the document content.
 • The build panel has been redsigned. It is placed on the left now to keep
   our workflow something like Left->Right.
 • The global search has been replaced to fit with the mockups, on the
   top-right corner of the window. We expect more improvements to search
   in upcoming releases.
 • The "new-document" button has been replaced with a menu for various
   types of new documents.
 • Manu previous extension points now use menus.ui to populate their menu
   content. This makes extending menus much more consistent across Builder.
 • Document preferences (tab size, spaces, language, etc) have been moved
   into a transient sidebar. You can activate this with the menu item from
   the document header.
 • An "Open Pages" section has been added to the panel. It's not yet clear
   if this will continue to be enabled by default or if it will be a plugin
   that can be enabled.
 • The beautifier plugin has yet to be ported to the new engine, and therefore
   is disabled by default in this release.

Thanks in advance to all of our testers!


==============
Version 3.25.3
==============

This release includes some major changes for packagers. Builder is now built
using the Meson build system. Given the number of GNOME packages following this
trend, chances are that packagers will have existing scripts to help make this
a smooth transition.

Changes since 3.25.2

 • The "egg" contrib package has been broken out into libdazzle. If you do
   not have libdazzle, it will be built as a subproject.
   http://git.gnome.org/browse/libdazzle
 • The "jsonrpc-glib" contrib package has been broken out into a standalone
   project. It will be built as a subproject if you do not have it installed.
   http://git.gnome.org/browse/jsonrpc-glib
 • The "template-glib" contrib package has been broken out into a standalone
   project. It will be built as a subproject if you do not have it installed.
   http://git.gnome.org/browse/template-glib
 • Ctags completion priority has been lowered
 • Many internals have been moved to an updated libdazzle. This includes lots
   of theming fixes as well as improved panels and theming integration. Many
   search data structures were also broken out into libdazzle.
 • The search provider has been rewritten to use libdazzle and the new
   suggestion entry. We expect more changes here before 3.26.
 • Builder now uses GVFS metadata to store the cursor position. This should
   improve the chances you end up on the right position when re-opening a
   buffer.
 • Panels now properly maintain their visibility state between runs of Builder.
 • The flatpak plugin now properly ignores runtimes ending in ".Sources".
 • Builder properly cleans up drafts fixing an issue where files with encoding
   errors would continually re-open when restoring Builder's internal state.
 • A "counters" window has been added to aide in debugging.
 • Builder now tries to do significantly less work while the buffer is opening.
   This should speed up file-loading on larger files.
 • Various async operation priority have been lowered to avoid stalling the
   Gtk main loop.
 • UI files now strip their empty space which should reduce the size of libide
   a small amount.
 • IdePerspective now has a restore_state vfunc. This helps ensure that the
   widget restores state after the UI has settled. This can help avoid hickups
   in the UI at startup.
 • Python Ide.py overrides now have helpers to log using g_warning() etc. See
   Ide.warning(), Ide.debug(), Ide.critical(), etc.
 • Additional documentation.

==============
Version 3.25.2
==============

We anticipate 3.25.2 to be our last release using autotools. Our
development tree will switch to meson after this release.

Changes since 3.25.1

 • Improvements to the Todo plugin
 • Support for multiple cursors in the text editor
 • Improvements to invalidations behind gtk container widgets
 • Use after free fixes
 • Memory leak fixes

==============
Version 3.25.1
==============

The road to 3.26 has begun, and 3.25.1 is here to kick that off.

 • A new retab plugin to reindent your source code.
 • Auto-save can now be configured.
 • A new notification plugin to notify of build completion.
 • Preview support for Sphinx.
 • Improved jump support in the editor.
 • The "install" action can be run from the command-bar to install
   your project without running.
 • Word completion minimum length can now be configured.
 • Ctags improvements.
 • A save button has been added to the Build Log.
 • Release auto-save timeout after a manual save to reduce the
   number of file-system operations.
 • Allow jhbuild from alternate PATHs.
 • Animation improvements, including support for animating based on
   screen DPI and physical space. This has the potential to make
   animations smoother, but may cause issues with miss-reporting
   EDID information. Mitigations are provided.
 • Do not download SDKs or dependencies when on metered connections.
   This can be disabled in preferences.
 • Bump vala requirement to 0.38.
 • The editor now supports text-wrapping but is not enabled by default
   due to the performance penalty.
 • Plugins are discovered in ~/.local/share/gnome-builder/plugins, even
   when distributed under Flatpak.
 • Don't take into account failed or cancelled transfers when calculating
   transfer progress.
 • Various build tooling widgetry will become insensitive while the build
   pipeline is not useable.
 • Language Server Protocol improvements.
 • Various memory leaks and bug fixes.
