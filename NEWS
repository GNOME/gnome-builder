==============
Version 3.29.3
==============

Changes since last release:

 • Initial support for the gradle build system.
 • Updated sensible defaults for the Java programming language.
 • Various performance and correctness fixes.
 • Additional support for sysroots and toolchain selection.
 • A memory leak of editor buffers has been fixed.
 • The jedi plugin was updated to support more recent releases.
 • The code indexer and other plugins will now ignore the node_modules
   directory when the npm plugin has been loaded.
 • You can now specify a branch name other than "master" when cloning
   a git repository.
 • Plugins in ~/.local/share/gnome-builder/plugins will have higher
   priority which simplifies the process of creating and testing new
   plugins out-of-tree such as when using Flatpak.

==============
Version 3.29.2
==============

Changes since last release:

 • Fixes for DTD and RNG processing in xml-pack plugin
 • Improvements to the vim-style search and replace command
 • Continued improvements to the new sysroot plugin
 • A new IdeToolchain abstraction has been added to help with systems
   where multiple toolchains can exist within a runtime. We expect this
   to be used later on for some cross-compiling.
 • Various build systems have been migrated to toolchain support
 • Various memory leak fixes
 • Improved support for using subprocesses to perform compiler work
 • Clang support has been moved out-of-process using the new
   gnome-builder-clang subprocess. Clang-based auto-completion is temporarily
   disabled until a future development release.
 • A preferences button has been re-added to the perspective switcher
 • Memory overhead of the clang plugin has been vastly reduced
 • The code-indexer now uses less memory
 • The highlighter can now deal with delayed requests to load a new
   highlight index. It more correctly follows up on incorrectly highlighted
   lines of code.
 • A spinloop was fixed when opening certain files with double-click from
   the project tree.

==============
Version 3.29.1
==============

Changes since last release:

 • A new threadpool and tasking engine has landed which provides
   much more safety guarantees in how tasks are processed off
   main-thread and results proxied back to the destination thread.
   This greatly improves the guarantees we can provide to threaded
   workers. Threadpools are segmented by type kind of work, and tasks
   can be pinned to certain threadpools to choke the number of concurrent
   tasks in flight.
 • Most subsystems have now been ported to IdeTask to take advantage of
   our new threading engine.
 • A new "Runtime Terminal" shell has been provided which is a terminal
   in the runtime environment of the application. This means that
   desktop applications will have access to the wayland or X11 sockets
   if configured to do so in the flatpak manifest.
 • Builder tries harder to ignore minified JSON files when performing
   various background work like TODO extraction.
 • The buffer manager now short-circuits a file-save request when the
   buffer has not changed from the on-disk version.
 • The build manager tries to avoid rediagnosing in a number of situations.
 • The code-indexer interface has been improved to support off-main-thread
   indexing in an asynchronous manner. Clang and Vala indexers have been
   improved to support this.
 • A new sysroot plugin has been added to allow building against an alternate
   sysroot than that of the host system. We expect further expansion in this
   area for toolchain selection in the future.
 • A new ctrl+shift+k keybinding has been added to jump to symbol search
   within the current document.
 • Many API improvements to simplify access from language bindings.
 • Flatpak "simple" build systems now run the commands from the srcdir
   matching more closely to what flatpak-builder will do.
 • XML plugin improvements for performance, stability and DTD tracking.
 • GDB integration now properly updates frames for the selected thread.
 • Various terminal improvements.
 • Various memory leak fixes.
 • The build manager tries to avoid reseting the build pipeline in
   certain situations.
 • Support for rofiles-fuse has been added to speed up flatpak cachepoint
   generation.
 • Improvements to build flag parsing across entire directories.
