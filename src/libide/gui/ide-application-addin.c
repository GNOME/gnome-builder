 * @title: IdeApplicationAddin
 * @short_description: extend functionality of #IdeApplication
 *
 * The #IdeApplicationAddin interface is used by plugins that want to extend
 * the set of features provided by #IdeApplication. This is useful if you need
 * utility code that is bound to the lifetime of the #IdeApplication.
 *
 * The #IdeApplicationAddin is created after the application has initialized
 * and unloaded when Builder is shut down.
 *
 * Use this interface when you can share code between multiple projects that
 * are open at the same time.
 *
 * Since: 3.32
