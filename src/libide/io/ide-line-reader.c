 *
 * Moves forward to the beginning of the next line in the buffer. No changes to the buffer
 * are made, and the result is a pointer within the string passed as @contents in
 * ide_line_reader_init(). Since the line most likely will not be terminated with a NULL byte,
 * you must provide @length to determine the length of the line.

 * Returns: (transfer none): The beginning of the line within the buffer.
