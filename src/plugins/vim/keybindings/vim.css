/*
 * Contributing:
 *
 * There are a lot of corner cases that vim handles. As you can see from the
 * text below, we do not handle all of them. If you would like to contribute
 * something that is missing, please do!
 *
 * In general, we use the selectors at the bottom to determine which binding
 * sets are active in a mode.
 *
 * "set-mode" is used to move our way through the state machine. Take a look
 * at the current uses to get an idea. "permanent" means that the mode will
 * stay active until it has been released (by Escape or something). transient
 * means that the the mode will disappear after a followup key press. However,
 * transient mode may simply trigger another transient mode. (cip would be
 * an example of this.
 *
 * If you need more advanced operations than you can perform, you might have
 * to dig into IdeSourceView to add a new GSignal (with G_SIGNAL_ACTION flag).
 * Any signal with G_SIGNAL_ACTION set in the following widget hierarchy
 * should be callable from these bindings.
 *
 *   - GtkWidget
 *     - GtkTextView
 *       - GtkSourceView
 *         - IdeSourceView
 *
 * For example, you could make the ficticious three-finger-salute keybinding
 * to delete the entire buffer like so:
 *
 *   bind "<ctrl><alt>delete" { "movement" (first-line, 0, 0, 0)
 *                              "movement" (last-line, 1, 0, 0)
 *                              "movement" (last-char, 1, 0, 0)
 *                              "copy-clipboard-extended" ()
 *                              "delete-selection" () };
 *
 * The "movement" action takes three parameters.
 *
 *   1) If we want to extend the selection with the movement. Otherwise, it
 *      will be cleared.
 *   2) If the movement is exclusive. See :help exlusive in vim.
 *   3) If the current count (digit prefix) should be applied to the movement.
 *
 * The first line will move the cursor to line and column 0:0. The second
 * movement will extend the selection to the last line of the file (1
 * indicates TRUE to the second action parameter "extend_selection").
 * The third movement will move to the end of the current line (now the last
 * line due to second movement). We then copy to the clipboard just to be
 * nice, and then delete the whole thing from the buffer.
 *
 * NOTE: the exclusive/inclusive parameters are probably not right. They need
 *       either careful study or battle testing.
 *
 * That's pretty much it, happy Vim'ing!
